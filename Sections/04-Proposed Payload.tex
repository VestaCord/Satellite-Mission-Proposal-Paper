\section{Proposed Payload}
\subsection{Instrumental Requirements Measurements}

    \textbf{LiDAR} High-resolution (<10m), ability to penetrate vegetation for Height Volume Topography.
    \textbf{Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)} High spatial resolution (<30m), capability to penetrate clouds and operate day/night for Floodplain and Floodway Profile.
    \textbf{Hyperspectral Sensors} High spectral resolution (10 nm or better), multiple bands covering visible to near-infrared spectrum, for quantifying sediments, organic materials, and fish habitats.
    \textbf{UV-IR Sensor} Moderate to high spatial resolution (5-30 meters) to monitor conditions for Sediments, Organic Grit, Biomass.
    \textbf{High-Resolution Optical Cameras} Very high spatial resolution (sub-meter), capability to capture clear images under various lighting conditions to identify trash, pollutants, and build floodplain profile. \textit{See Annex for budgeting and scheduling.}
