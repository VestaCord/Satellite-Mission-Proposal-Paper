\section{Proposed Mission Configuration and Profile}
\textbf{Sun Synchronous Orbit, crossing 13-20°N latitude and 103°E longitude} \(SMA=7078 km, ECC=0, INC=98°, RAAN = 103°, AoP = 0, TA =0\): RAAN, AoP, TA are values upon injection. RAAN precess at approximately 1° per day.

\textbf{System Requirements} High precision (less than 0.1 degrees) to ensure accurate targeting of regions of interest, maintain optimal sun angle for passive optical sensors; typically 10-30 degrees off nadir for best illumination

\subsection{Mission Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Revisit time over the target area no longer than 24 hours, ensuring frequent data acquisition.
    \item Novel data generated shall be downloaded within one orbit after acquisition to ensure timely availability for analysis.
    \item Regular calibration and validation with on-ground measurements and cross-validation with existing satellite data (MODIS, IKONOS).
    \item Integrate collected data with historical records and on-the-ground observations, utilizing AI-based models for prediction and analysis.
    \item Employ atmospheric correction algorithms to remove interference from the atmosphere and enhance data accuracy.
\end{itemize}
